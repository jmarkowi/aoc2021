# Advent of Code 2021

This repo will contain all the puzzle inputs (full and test) and my solutions for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge, which runs from December 1 through December 25. My solutions will be primarily in Python, although I may try out some challenges in other languages once I've solved them in Python.

**Repo structure:**
Each day gets its own folder. Each folder contains the raw input given for that day's puzzle as a `.txt` file; there will also be a `test_input.txt` to make use of the test cases given in each puzzle's description.

I'm used to using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to work in code, but I also want to learn to use VS Code and running `.py` files for simpler scripts, so we'll see if I can get that off the ground as well.
