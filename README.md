# Advent of Code 2021

This repo will contain all the puzzle inputs (full and test) and my solutions for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge, which runs from December 1 through December 25. My solutions will be primarily in Python, usually written with commentary/notes in a Jupyter Notebook. (Maybe I'll try out some challenges in other languages once I've solved them in Python???)

**Repo structure:**

Each day gets its own folder. Each folder contains the raw input given for that day's puzzle as a `.txt` file; there will also be a `test_input.txt` to make use of the test cases given in each puzzle's description.
  
  Example:
  ```
  aoc2021
  ├── day_1
  │   ├── day_1.ipynb
  │   ├── input_1.txt
  │   ├── test_input_1.txt
  ```

## Merry AOC 2021! 🎅🏻
